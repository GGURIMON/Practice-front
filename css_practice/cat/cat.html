        The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous
        mammal. It
        is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
        domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm
        cat,
        but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability
        to
        kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong,
        flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It
        is a
        social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes
        vocalizations—including
        meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting–as well as body language. It can hear sounds too
        faint
        or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives
        pheromones.

        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in
        equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown
        at
        events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be
        achieved
        by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of
        feral
        cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species.

        As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned
        and
        around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an
        estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned
        and
        480 million stray cats in the world.

    <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
    <p>
        The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was
        first
        used at the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African
        language.[5] The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[6]
    </p>
    <p>
        The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was absorbed into Latin and then into
        Greek,
        Syriac, and Arabic.[7] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be
        borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi, 'female stoat', and Hungarian hölgy, 'lady, female stoat'; from
        Proto-Uralic *käďwä, 'female (of a furred animal)'.[8]

        The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced
        from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar
        forms
        exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have
        arisen
        from a sound used to attract a cat.[9][10]
    </p>
    <p>
        A male cat is called a tom or tomcat[11] (or a gib,[12] if neutered). A female is called a queen[13][14] (or
        sometimes a molly,[15] if spayed). A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early Modern English, the word
        kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.[16] A group of cats can be referred to as a
        clowder,
        a glaring,[17] or a colony.[18]

        Taxonomy
        The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat.[1][2] Felis catus
        domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777.[3] Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin
        Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.[19][20]
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct
        species,
        namely Felis catus.[21][22] In 2007, the modern domesticated subspecies F. silvestris catus sampled worldwide
        was
        considered to have likely descended from the African wildcat (F. lybica), following results of phylogenetic
        research.[23][24][a] In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce followed the recommendation of the ICZN in
        regarding the domestic cat as a distinct species, Felis catus.[25]
